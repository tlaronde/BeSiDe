.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pathsearch
.Nd when and how the search of a file to execute is handled.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A program to execute is given to a shell or to one of the
.Xr exec 3
or 
.Xr posix_spawn 3
families of functions in one of two forms: either as a
.Em locator
specifying exactly (even if implicitly) where the file is, or as an
.Em identifier
in order to be searched for. POSIX generally uses
.Em path
to mean what we here call a locator and
.Em file
to mean what we call an identifier.
.Pp
The shells
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
as well as the variants of the
.Xr execlp 3
and
.Xr execvp 3
functions, and the
.Xr posix_spawnp 3
function (used by the implementation of
.Xr system 3 )
handle both locators and identifiers. The other variants of
.Xr exec 3
and
.Xr posix_spawn 3
expect only locators and do no path searching.
.Pp
For the path searching, two environment variables drive the searching:
.Dv PATH
and
.Dv PATH_SEARCH_OPT .
.Pp
In order for the searching to be done, the command given as argument
has to be considered an identifier, not a locator.
.Pp
The traditional POSIX rule for this is simple: when path searching is
to be attempted, if the command name given does not contain a
.Ql \&/ ,
it is considered an identifier and is then searched for. Otherwise, it
is a locator and no search is done.
.Pp
Hence, with the traditional behavior, given a command as 
.Pa bar/foo ,
no path searching would be done and thus the file must exist in the
current working directory.
.Pp
The rules concerning what is an identifier can be changed using the
.Dv PATH_SEARCH_OPT
environment variable. See
.Sx Extending identifiers to qualified filenames
below.
.Pp
When the argument is considered an identifier (according to whatever
rule), it is not searched for everywhere but only in the directories
specified in the
.Dv PATH
environment variable.
.Pp
The
.Dv PATH
is a sequence of colon
.Ql \&:
separated directory pathnames to be tried, in turn, for locating the
identified resource. There are default values defined in
.Pa paths.h
used by various programs.
Initially, it is set to
.Pp
.Dl /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/local/bin
.Pp
by
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr rshd 8 ,
.Xr rexecd 8 .
It is also the default value used by
.Xr execvp 3
and
.Xr posix_spawnp 3 
if
.Dv PATH
is not in the
.Xr environ 7 .
.Pp
.Xr init 8
sets it to
.Pp
.Dl /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
.Pp
and this value is also used by
.Xr ttyaction 3 ,
.Xr whereis 1
or as the default value used by
.Xr sysctl 8
when setting
.Dv user.cs_path .
.Pp
.Dv PATH
can be redefined by the user.
.Pp
An empty dir specification (which can be expressed in
.Dv PATH
by a leading or a trailing colon, or by two consecutive colons)
means the current working directory. This is considered a security
risk in most environments since, by the very nature of the current
working directory, what will be executed depends on the context.
It is thus highly recommended to verify that a non intended empty dir
alternative is not present in
.Dv PATH . 
.Pp
The
.Xr sh 1
syntax allows for example to interpolate a dir specification via a
variable, but supports protecting PATH from accidental interpolation
of an empty directory specification due to an unset variable, using
syntax such as
.Pp
.Dl PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:${MYSCRIPTS:+${MYSCRIPTS}:}/usr/pkg/bin"
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Dl PATH="/bin:/usr/bin${MYSCRIPTS:+:${MYSCRIPTS}}:/usr/pkg/bin"
.Pp
Here, the variable is expanded only if it is defined and not empty,
and in this case only a colon is appended (resp. prepended),
the result being that if the
.Dv MYSCRIPTS
variable is not defined, or empty, no two consecutive
colons are unintentionally added to the definition of
.Dv PATH .
See
.Xr sh 1
for an explanation of the syntax.
.Ss Extending identifiers to qualified filenames
The environment variable
.Dv PATH_SEARCH_OPT
can be defined to change the path searching.
.Pp
The definition of the PATH_SEARCH_OPT is a string of ASCII letters
(the options are case sensitive).
.Pp
At the moment, only one option is defined:
.Bl -tag -width "Q"
.It Q
The rule identifying an identifier is changed to allow qualified
filenames like
.Qq bar/foo
to be searched for via the PATH. A
.Em qualified filename
is a Resource Identifier (not a locator) consisting of a sequence
of one or more components separated by
.Ql / ,
the sequence not starting or ending with a
.Ql /
and comprising no path walk directives (relative paths, double dot
.Qq \&.\&.
or single dot:
.Qq \&. .
Thus
.Pa fs/create ,
.Pa fs/ck ,
.Pa fs/mount ,
.Pa fs/ctl
are all qualified filenames, as well as
.Pa texlive/latex
or
.Pa kertex/latex ,
as well as (G.R.A.S.S. example)
.Pa vect/in/dxf .
But 
.Pa /vect/in/dxf
is not an identifier but a locator, as well as
.Pa ./vect/in/dxf
or
.Pa vect/in/../out/dxf
or even
.Pa vect/in/./dxf . The main difference with the traditional behavior,
except for allowing using subdirectories in the identifier, is that
an identifier like
.Pa bar/foo
will not be executed, if found, in the current working directory, but
will be searched for.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Since the behavior cannot be changed only at a shell level if it has
to work also when passing an utility identifier as an argument to
another utility, there has to be a way to inform both the shell
and the libc to change the behavior. Hence the
.Dv PATH_SEARCH_OPT
environment variable. And since it would be suboptimal to create
another variable when something has to be optionally changed in the way
the path is searched, the variable has not only to exist in the
environment but also has to not be empty.
.Pp
The upper case was chosen because, initially, there was a lower case
variant meaning: do qualified filename searching if not
.Dv POSIXLY_CORRECT .
But if this extended behavior is not, strictly speaking, POSIX
compliant, it is not a violation of the spirit: a qualified filename
is an identifier, not a locator which is a partial path walk
specification; a qualified filename cannot escape the directory.
In this sense, and without judging the relevance of the notion of a
.Qq restricted shell ,
as is expressed, for example, in
.Xr ksh 1 ,
a qualified filename is neither absolute nor relative, so is
compatible with the notion. So the lower case variant was dropped, but
the principle of distinguishing between lower case (conditional) and
upper case (mandatory) is retained for possible further extensions.
.Pp
The fact that, when extended filenames search is requested, a command
passed as
.Pa bar/foo
will be searched and not executed in the current directory, thus
imposing, if it was actually the intention to do so, to specify it as
.Pa ./bar/foo
is not considered a slight inconvenient but an improvement.
Altogether, since, with the traditional behavior, when simply specifying
.Pa foo
the search is done, if
.Pa bar/boo
is to be considered an identifier, the rule has not to be different:
searched too, so not executed in the current working directory.
