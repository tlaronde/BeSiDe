WHAT IS THERE
=============

This is a fork of the NETBSD src tree providing on different branches some work I (Thierry Laronde [TL]) have done on various subjects.

The main branch is named: tsjl

On this branch, at the root of the tree:

CHANGES.tsjl        Gives a summary of the main changes, separated between kernel related work and userland work;

WIP.tsjl            Gives a summary of what is in progress immediately (not yet published);

GOALS.tsjl          Gives a summary of the goals and links to further documentation outside the main src tree.
