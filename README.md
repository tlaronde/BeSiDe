WHAT IS THERE
=============

This is a fork of the NETBSD src tree (The NetBSD developers hence
have provided the huge majority of what is here) providing on an uniq
branch for now the integrated modifications and contributions I have
donc around NetBSD. It is WIP.

**For the bulk of the work, it is synchronized with the NetBSD git src
master (so the "contributors" on the right of the page are not
"contributors" of this fork, but authors of modifications
reflected in this tree every time I merge the NetBSD src tree in this
fork).**

At the root of the tree:

- *CHANGES.tsjl*        Gives a summary of the main changes, separated between kernel related work and userland work;

- *WIP.tsjl*            Gives a summary of what is in progress immediately (not yet published);

- *GOALS.tsjl*          Gives a summary of the goals and links to further documentation outside the main src tree.
