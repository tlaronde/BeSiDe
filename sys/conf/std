# standard MI 'options'

# this file is for options which can't be off-by-default for some reasons.
# "it's commonly used" is NOT a good reason to enable options here.

# Always include "kern" attribute (module).  Other attributes don't need to
# depend on "kern".

select	kern

# Always include the "vfs" attribute (module).  Although all of the
# ufs/xxx file systems depend on the vfs attribute, it is not required
# that any file system actually be built-in to the kernel.  (At least
# on some architectures, file system modules can be loaded at boot
# time.)

# the following options are on-by-default to keep
# kernel config file compatibility.
options	VMSWAP		# Swap device/file support
options	BUFQ_FCFS	# First-come First-serve strategy
options	BUFQ_DISKSORT	# Traditional min seek sort strategy
options	RFC2292		# Previous version of Adv. Sockets API for IPv6 
options	PTRACE		# Include ptrace(2) syscall
options	PTRACE_HOOKS	# Include ptrace hooks
options	COREDUMP	# allow processes to coredump.
options	AIO		# POSIX asynchronous I/O
options	MQUEUE		# POSIX message queues

# Common compatibility functions. They happen to be needed even when
# no compatibility option is explicitly enabled.

# This could be taken out of conf/std now that the entropy pool and
# kernel random number generation API is part of kern proper --

# other on reading from /dev/urandom.
