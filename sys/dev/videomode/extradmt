# The format shall be the same as the one described in the file "dmt"
# (see this file for reference).
#
# These values are just the VESA EDID Established timings that are not
# given in VESA DMT.
#
# They are derived from XFree86:
# xsrc/external/mit/xorg-server/dist/hw/xfree86/modes/xf86EdidModes.c
#
# For one value, the XFree86 file "xf86EdidModes.c" uses 1152x864@75Hz
# instead of the specified 1152x870@75Hz. We derive our parameters,
# instead, for the specified 1152x870@75Hz from the Linux file:
#
# drivers/video/fbdev/macmodes.c
#
# It must be noted that XFree86 and the Linux kernel, at least for
# the other Mac modes, do not agree...
#
# Since the values given do not specify the margins, for a line or a
# frame, and since the GTF doesn't apply (none of the parameters found
# from the above sources correspond to a GTF timing), all margins
# are taken as 0 and the blanking time is all in the porch times.
#
# This does mean that the "specifications" below are definitively _not_
# authoritative and should be taken for what they are worth.

# with 8 pixels glyphes, the 9th pixel being the 8th pixel repeated,
# leading to a better separation of characters).
# There is a discrepancy in the dot clocks: the VGA dot clocks seems
# to have been fixed 25.175MHz and this is not what is given here...
