                WORK IN PROGRESS (NOT PUBLISHED)
                           2023-12-19

- X11 userspace: adding infrastructure to compile whatever is current,
with R.I.S.K. (my own compile infrastructure) so that I can track down
bugs in Mesa;

- drm / drmkms: verify if the legacy user space drivers (for i915)
can still be used and chase also the bug about artefacts linked
to memory problem (not updated; cache...) => Note: these artefacts may
not be a kernel cache problem but instead, userland problem with
futexes: NetBSD is the only system to not use futexes and this could
be the source of the problem, disappearing on heavy load because there
are less concurrent X11 program threads stepping on each other toes.
